# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that visualizes sorting algorithms in real time.  
It allows you to see how different sorting algorithms work on a set of random numbers, step by step, with adjustable animation speed and array size.

**Built with:**  
- **React** (with TypeScript)  
- **Vite**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  

---

## Currently Implemented Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** 
- **Selection Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

---

## Features
- Generate random data to sort.
- Adjust the number of elements in the array.
- Control animation speed (in ms).
- Start, Pause, Continue, Restart, and Abort the animation.
- Speed = 0 runs the algorithm instantly; Speed > 0 plays step-by-step.

- Color indicators:
  - General
    - ğŸŸ¢ Green: elements that are already sorted/final
    - ğŸ”´ Red: currently compared elements
    - ğŸ”µ Blue: default bars
  - Quick Sort specifics (Lomuto-style partition visualization)
    - ğŸŸ  Orange: pivot (shown at the end of the current range during partition)
    - ğŸŸ£ Purple: i pointer (boundary of the < pivot region)
    - ğŸ”´ Red: j pointer (current element being scanned)
    - ğŸ”µ Blue: active subarray [low..high]
    - ğŸ”µ Dim: bars outside the current subarray are dimmed
